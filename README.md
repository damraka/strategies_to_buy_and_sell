## 📈 Strategy Backtester
# 🧠 Overview

Using historical market data, this project provides a thorough and modular framework for assessing trading strategies. It includes a functional mean reversion strategy implementation, demonstrating the transparent and rigorous testing, evaluation, and visualization of systematic models.

This backtesting suite, which was designed with flexibility in mind, allows both quantitative researchers and discretionary traders to investigate and refine algorithmic strategies through reliable simulation and performance monitoring.
🚀 Features

    Implementation of the Mean Reversion Strategy
    An actual implementation of a tried-and-true method based on statistical hypotheses regarding price movements.

    Engine for Backtesting
    accurately calculates position changes and portfolio returns by simulating the execution of trading signals against historical price data.

    Metrics of Performance
    produces important KPIs like:

        Cumulative returns

        Volatility

        Sharpe ratio

        Maximum drawdown

        Win/loss ratios
        for in-depth strategy evaluation.

    Visual Analytics
    Supports data-driven insights and model diagnostics by offering clear, educational plots that show both price action and trading signals.
